# Just Another Text Editor

## Description
This is a text editor that fulfills the criteria of a progressive web app. The text editor is quick, responsive, functions offline, saves data locally, and can be downloaded like a native app. 

## Instructions

### App usage
The app functions like a basic text editor. When users click out of the text editor, it will save everything that has been entered. If the browser allows installation, users will see a install button. If a user downloads the app, an icon will appear on the desktop. If the user wishes to uninstall, look for "add and remove programs" in the Windows search bar and find "Just Another Text Editor" in the list.

### Scripts

The following scripts can be used from the root directory:

* `npm run start:dev` Runs the server and provides live reloading.
* `npm start` Bundles the client files with webpack and starts the server. Unless otherwise noted in the console, the app can be accessed at http://localhost:3000.
* `npm run server` Starts up the server.
* `npm run build` Bundles the client files with webpack.
* `npm install` Installs all necessary dependencies to run the app.
* `npm run client` Only starts the client.

QUICKSTART: run `npm install && npm start`, then wait for the console to respond with `Now listening on port: (number)`. Then navigate to http://localhost:(number).
